# Hangman

Welcome to Hangman! This is my first game, created for project one. It is used as an example of the skills we have use thus far in HTML CSS and Javascript.

## Inscructions
**Player One** will start the game, begin by adding in a name for the player so the data can be scored locally.

**The Challenger** will be player two, this game keeps a running tally of how many times **player one** has been defeated by an outside challenger.

#### Play:

**The challenger** selects the first word, **player one** is on the honor system here and closes their eyes. 
Once **the challenger** hits submit, **player one** can start guessing letters.

Once the turn ends, it is **player One**'s turn to pick a word and **the challenger** gets to guess.

#### Scoring:
If the guesser gets the correct answer, they receive one point.
If the guesser does not get the correct answer, their opponent receives a point. 

## Technologies Used
This game uses HTML CSS and javascript
It also utilizes local user storage
**coming soon** Random Word API for single player
